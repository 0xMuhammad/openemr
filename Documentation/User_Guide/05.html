<h2>Using The Calendar</h2>
<p>In this section we'll  discuss setting up a provider's schedule in the calendar and adding  patient appointments.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Schedules</h3>
<p>Login to OpenEMR using  your assigned username and password. </p>
<img src="processed/036.png" />
<p>For users who are not  practitioners, such as someone who works at the front desk, the  Calendar will show the schedules of all the practitioners at the  clinic by default.  When you first start using OpenEMR you will need  to set up schedules for all of your practitioners.</p>
<p>To do this, select from  the 'Providers' list on the right the person who's schedule you wish  to set up.  Next click the time at which that provider is scheduled  to enter the office.</p>
<img src="processed/037.png" />
<p>This will present you with  the 'Add New Event' dialog box. </p>
<p>The clinic and provider  name should be automatically filled in for you, as well as the time  that you selected.  Choose “In Office” from the 'Category'  drop-down list. </p>
<img src="processed/038.png" />
<p>You can also choose to  make this a repeating event, which allows you to set up an event only  once for a given period of time. Do this by selecting the 'Repeats'  checkbox, and setting the appropriate frequency &amp; duration.</p>
<p>When you are finished  click 'Save' to update the calendar.  Now you will see a block of  available time slots for that provider's schedule.  Scroll down and  click on the time that the provider is scheduled to leave the office  for the day.</p>
<p>The same process is used  to create a repeating “Out Of Office” event.</p>
<img src="processed/039.png" />
<p>You can also add a lunch  break in your practitioners' schedules.  This is done the same way,  with the exception of the duration, which in this case is non-zero.</p>
<img src="processed/040.png" />
<p>Now you can see your  practitioner's full schedule laid out on the Calendar page.  Continue  setting up the Calendar in this fashion until all your practitioners'  schedules have been entered.</p>

<h3>Making Appointments</h3>
<p>Now that the clinic and  all it's practitioners are set up, you can begin scheduling  appointments for your patients.</p>
<p>To locate a patient in the  system, enter all or part of their name into the search field in the  bottom left corner of the screen (below the navigation list) and  click 'Name'.  This will bring up a list of all the patients in your  system matching that name.  If you need to narrow the list, you can  enter a longer search term, such as their full name (Eg. “rourk,  rod”).</p>
<img src="processed/043.png" />
<p>Click on the desired name  to bring up the Demographics summary for that patient.  If you have  the patient on the phone, now would be a good time to confirm that  their contact and insurance information is up to date.  If the  patient is not already in the system, you can select 'New/Search'  from the menu to begin entering their information.</p>
<img src="processed/044.png" />
<p>The right-hand side of the  Demographics summary shows a list of all current and future  appointments for that patient.  Click 'New Appointment' to schedule  an office visit.</p>
<img src="processed/045.png" />
<p>This will present you with  the same 'Add New Event' dialog used earlier.  This time “Established  Patient” is selected as the Category.  You can change the category  to “New Patient” if this is their first visit.  If a primary  provider has been entered for that patient, they will be selected  automatically.</p>
<p>Click 'Find Available' to  see a list of appointment times available for that provider for the  next 7 days.  You can change the start date or the number of days  shown and click 'Search' to display a new list using those   parameters. </p>
<img src="processed/046.png" />
<p>Once a date and time have  been agreed upon, selecting that time from the list will close the  window, and the selected time will appear in the 'Add Event' dialog. </p>
<img src="processed/047.png" />
<p>Make sure to enter the  correct duration for the appointment and click 'Save'.</p>
<p>Return to the calendar  using the navigation menu on the left.  Advancing to the appropriate  date, using the  arrows at the top of the screen, shows the new  appointment listed in the provider's schedule.  Mousing over the  appointment displays a toot-tip with information about that patient,  such as date of birth.</p>

<h3>Appointment Status</h3>
<p>OpenEMR's calendar system  includes a status indicator, allowing doctors and staff to see at a  glance what is going on with all appointments and the corresponding  encounters for the day. </p>
<p>To change the status of a  given appointment, double-click on the appointment block.  This  brings up the 'Edit Event' window.  Choose the correct appointment  status from the drop-down list.  Notice each status has a unique  symbol associated with it.</p>
<img src="processed/049.png" />
<p>You can also type a note  into the 'Comments' line if more information is needed.  Click 'Save'  to update the status of the appointment.</p>
<img src="processed/050.png" />
<p>You can see that the  symbol next to the appointment time has changed to indicate it's new  status.</p>
