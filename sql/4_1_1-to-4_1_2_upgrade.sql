--  #IfNotRow2Dx2
--    desc:      This is a very specialized function to allow adding items to the list_options table to avoid both redundant option_id and title in each element.
--    arguments: table_name colname value colname2 value2 colname3 value3
--    behavior:  The block will be executed if both statements below are true:
--               1) The table table_name does not have a row where colname = value AND colname2 = value2.

--  #IfIndex
--    desc:      This function is most often used for dropping of indexes/keys.
--    arguments: table_name colname
--    behavior:  If the table and index exist the relevant statements are executed, otherwise not.

--  #IfNotIndex
--    desc:      This function will allow adding of indexes/keys.
--    arguments: table_name colname
--    behavior:  If the index does not exist, it will be created
