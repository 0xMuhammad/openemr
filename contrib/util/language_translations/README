This directory holds the developer tools to maintain the language translations.
These were created during development of OpenEMR version 3.0.2

The collectConstants.pl script can be used to collect all of the constants
from the openemr source code.  This script can also be used to find only the
new constants.  Instructions are included in the file.

The first list of constants produced by the collectConstants.pl script are
in the initial_constants_3-0-1.txt file.

The initial empty language translation spreadsheet,
blank_spreadsheet_3-0-1.tsv,  that contains the constants was also created
by the collectConstants.pl script.  This spreadsheet has been uploaded to
Google Docs to allow collaborative data entry of languages translations.

The buildLanguageDatabase.pl builds the foreign language SQL tables dumpfile
for the lang_languages, lang_constants, and lang_definitions tables from the above
Google Docs collaborative language translation spreadsheet (spreadsheet is
downloaded from google docs into open office and then saved as a tab delimited
file before using as input in this script).

The stableLanguage.sql holds the tested and stable translation tables dumpfile.
(no production quality script yet)

The currentLanguage.sql holds current and possibly unstable translation
tables dumpfile (This was created from the 4/4/2009 collaborative
Google docs spreadsheet)

To insert these translation tables into your OpenEMR (please note, this
is currently experimental and will delete your current translation tables),
download the sql dumpfile to your computer. Then in OpenEMR go to 
admin -> Database -> Databases -> openemr -> SQL and click 'Browse'
button at the 'Or location of the textfile:' field. Select the sql dumpfile
you downloaded, then click 'Go' button.
