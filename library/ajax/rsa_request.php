/**
 * Controller to provide client with new RSA public keys to transmit encrypted data.
 *
 * <pre>
 * This is a simple wrapper so a browser can interface with the rsa_key_manager class.
 * When the browser requests this page, a new key pair is generated.
 * The public key is transmitted to the browser as a javascript compatible string, while the private key is stored
 * in the database so the server can decode encrypted messages sent by the browser in subsequent requests.
 * 
 * A typical data flow will be as follows.
 * 1. User fills out form on the browser and submits.  
 * 2. Browser makes ajax request to this page.
 * 3. Server generates a public key that it returns to the browser and a corresponding private key which it stores in the database.
 * 3. Browser uses library/js/rsa.js routines to encrypt the sensitive data with the public key retrieved in step 2.
 * 4. Browser does POST or GET to server.  REQUEST includes the public key used as well as the encrypted data.
 * 5. Server uses public key in REQUEST to lookup corresponding private key and initialize rsa_key_manager
 * 6. Server can decrypt messages from the browser (such as clear text passwords).
 * 7. Server deletes that key pair from the database, so subsequent requests attempting to reuse the same message will fail.
 *      (Deletion/garbage collection actually happens as part of initialization in step 5)
 * </pre>
