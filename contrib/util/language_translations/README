This directory holds the developer tools to maintain the language translations.
These were created during development of OpenEMR version 3.0.2

The collectConstants.pl script can be used to collect all of the constants
from the openemr source code.  This script can also be used to find only the
new constants.  Instructions are included in the file.

The first list of constants produced by the collectConstants.pl script are
in the initial_constants_3-0-1.txt file.

The initial empty language translation spreadsheet,
blank_spreadsheet_3-0-1.tsv,  that contains the constants was also created
by the collectConstants.pl script.  This spreadsheet has been uploaded to
Google Docs to allow collaborative data entry of languages translations.


Tools that still need to be completed:
- buildLanguageDatabase.pl will be created to build a dumpfile for the
lang_languages, lang_constants, and lang_definitions tables from the above
Google Docs collaborative language translation spreadsheet.
- stableLanguage.sql will hold tested and stable translation tables
- currentLanguage.sql will hold current and possible unstable translation
tables
