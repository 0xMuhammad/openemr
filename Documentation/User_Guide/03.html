<h2>Setting  Up Your Clinic</h2>
<p>To begin using OpenEMR, navigate to  your server's installation directory and log in using your assigned  username and password.</p>
<p>A successful login brings you to the  appointment calendar.  Before you begin scheduling appointments  you'll want to configure some basic information for your users.  To  start setting up your clinic, select 'Administration' from the  navigation list on the left of the screen.  This will bring up a list  of available administration pages.  Click 'Facilities' to  bring up the Facility Administration page.</p>
<img src="processed/004.png" />
<p>This is one of several  pages within the Administration section of OpenEMR.  Administration  also includes sections for managing your facility's Forms, Practice  information, Calendar categories, Lists, Database administration, and  more.  Links to these sections can be found in the left hand  navigation list under 'Administration' (or at the top of the page if  you're using one of the other navigation schemes).</p>
<h3>Facility Administration</h3>
<p>We'll start by setting up  your facility for your users.  There is a default clinic already  built in.  It will need to be updated with the correct information  for your clinic.  To do this, click 'edit' next to the line labeled  “Your Clinic Name Here”</p>
<p>This takes you to the Edit  Facility page.</p>
<img src="processed/005.png" />
<p>Enter the correct name,  address &amp; contact information for your clinic.  This information  will be used for billing, so make sure to include who to direct  billing information to, and enter your facility's NPI and CLIA  number.  Indicate whether your facility is a billing and/or service  location by clicking the checkbox next to the appropriate option.  If  your clinic is a billing location, you may also want to check the  “Accepts Assignment” box.</p>
<p>When you are finished  entering your clinic's information click the 'Update' button, then  click 'Back' to return to the Facility Administration page.</p>
<p>Your clinic may have  additional facilities in which care is given, such as a hospital.  To  add these, enter them into the “New Facility Information” section  and click the 'Add' button. </p>
<h3>User Administration</h3>
<p>Clicking 'Administration -  Users' in the navigation list will bring you to the User  Administration page.   The bottom of this page contains a list of  your clinic's users. If you have not yet added any users, then only  &quot;admin&quot; will be shown. </p>
<img src="processed/006.png" />
<p>You can add a new user by  filling in the form to the right of the &quot;New User&quot; heading  and then clicking 'Add.'  Or you can modify an existing user by  clicking the 'Edit' link next to that user's name. </p>
<img src="processed/007.png" />
<p>Clicking 'Edit' will bring  up the user's profile.  Here you can edit a user's password, facility  information and access controls, as well as their authorization  status.  Authorized users are practitioners, and will appear in the  appointment calendar.  They can also be associated with encounters  for billing purposes, and are able to authorize encounter information  entered by non-authorized users so that the encounter will be  billable.</p>
<p>To authorize your  practitioners click the 'Provider' check box in the User  Administration page.   Other facility staff do not need to be  authorized.  Practitioners will also need their UPIN and Federal Tax  ID entered for correct billing, as well as their Federal Drug ID for  prescription writing.</p>
<p>Once your user's  information has been updated successfully click 'Save' to return to  the User Administration page.</p>
<h3>Practice Administration</h3>
<p>Next you'll need to enter  the relevant practice information for your clinic.  This includes  pharmacy and insurance company information, as well as the types of  documents your clinic accepts.</p>
<p>Clicking the 'Practice'  link in the navigation menu will bring you to the Practice  Administration page.</p>
<img src="processed/008.png" />
<p>Click 'Add a Pharmacy' to  enter the contact information for your clinic's pharmacy.  A drop  down menu lets you select the preferred method for transferring  prescription information.  Once you've entered the correct  information, click 'Update' to save your new pharmacy.</p>
<img src="processed/009.png" />
<p>Before setting up any  insurance companies, you'll want to enter your X12 Partner  information.  These are the clearinghouses or large payers to whom  you will send electronic billing. Most practices will probably just  use a single clearinghouse. </p>
<p>To add one of these  clearinghouses, click on 'X12 Partners' and then click 'Add New  Partner'.</p>
<img src="processed/010.png" />
<p>The ID numbers that you  enter here will need to be provided to you by the  clearinghouse/partner. The Version number refers to the version of  the X12 837p protocol specification used and should probably not be  changed. Click 'Add' to save the information you've entered.</p>
<p>Selecting 'Insurance  Companies' from the links to the left of the page brings up a list of  Companies that have been added to your clinic.  If this is a new  installation of OpenEMR, this list will be empty.  You can add a new  insurance company by clicking 'Add a Company'.  Or, you can edit an  existing company by clicking on it's name in the list.</p>
<img src="processed/011.png" />
<p>Once  you have entered the correct information, click 'Update' to save any  changes, or add the new company to the list. </p>
<img src="processed/012.png" />
<p>In practice, many  insurance companies have multiple insurance plans with a separate  billing address for each plan.  At this time, you will need to add  each plan as a separate insurance company. </p>
<p>Many insurance companies  also assign their own doctor-specific ID numbers, and these numbers  must appear in your claims. Click on 'Insurance Numbers' to see a  list of your clinic's providers and their default ID numbers.</p>
<img src="processed/013.png" />
<p>Click on a provider's name  to bring up a list of insurance companies and the corresponding ID  numbers that have been entered for that provider. </p>
<img src="processed/014.png" />
<p>Selecting 'Add New...'  presents a form for adding this provider's numbers for another  insurance company. Fill in this information and click the 'Add'  button to save. You can also edit an existing set of numbers by  clicking on the company name in the list. </p>
<p>Note that one of the  selections in the drop down list of insurance companies is &quot;Default&quot;;  you can use this to fill in default numbers for insurance companies  not otherwise entered.</p>
<p>Next click on 'Edit  Categories'.  This displays a hierarchy of the different types of  documents that you can attach to a patient. The default set is shown.  To add more categories click on the desired parent name, fill in the  name of the new document type, and click 'Add Category' </p>
<img src="processed/015.png" />
<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>Select  'Lists' from the menu at left.  This brings you to OpenEMR's List  Management system.  This is where many of the selection lists within  OpenEMR are stored and edited.  Before you begin using OpenEMR you  will need to populate these lists with data appropriate to your  clinic.</p>
<img src="processed/016.png" />
<p>Select  'State' from the drop-down list.  OpenEMR comes configured with only  one state by default.  If your clinic sees patients from only one  state you can simply replace the default state by clicking in the  'ID' and 'Title' fields and replacing them with the appropriate  information.</p>
<p>Alternatively,  you can add multiple states by filling in the empty fields that are  provided for you.  You can also specify which state you would like to  use as the default by selecting the checkbox next to that state.</p>
<img src="processed/018.png" />
<p>When  you are finished modifying the list, click 'Save'.  This will update  the list and generates a new set of empty fields should you need to  add additional states to the list.</p>
<p>The  drop-down contains lists for Race/Ethnicity, common billing codes  that appear in the Fee Sheet, Price Levels, common Exams/Tests, etc.   All of these lists may be modified in this same manner.</p>
<img src="processed/019.png" />
<h3>Address Book</h3>
<p>OpenEMR  also contains a built-in address book for storing useful contact  information for your staff as well as other doctors, clinics, etc.  that your office may contact on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Select  'Addr Bk' (under 'Miscellaneous') from the navigation menu to bring  up your clinic's Address Book.</p>
<img src="processed/020.png" />
<p>This  will present you with a list of all of the contacts currently  contained in your Address Book.  Click on a person's name to edit  their contact information, or click 'Add New' to enter a new contact  into your address book.</p>
<p>In  the 'Add New Person' dialog box, select a title, and enter their name  and address.  If you are adding a physician to your address book, be  sure to include their UPIN and other ID numbers for billing and  referrals.  Entering a 'Specialty' will allow you to narrow your  search parameters when writing letters to a particular physician,  etc.</p>
<img src="processed/021.png" />
<p>When  you are finished entering the new contact information, click 'Save'.</p>
<p>Note  that the new contact has been added to the list.</p>
<img src="processed/022.png" />
<p>You  can search for a particular contact in the address book by entering  their name and/or specialty at the top of the page and clicking  'Search'.  This brings up a list of any contacts matching your search  parameters.</p>
