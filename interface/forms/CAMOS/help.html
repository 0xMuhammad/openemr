An introduction to CAMOS
</p>
<p>
CAMOS (Computer Aided Medical Ordering System) is, on the surface, 
just a fancy interface for organizing and choosing pieces of text 
to insert into a patient's chart.  It is designed to be intuitive
and easy to use.  In OpenEMR, CAMOS is a plug-in form that does
not require an upgrade to your current OpenEMR system to use 
(assuming you are using a relatively up-to-date system, probably
OpenEMR 2.6 and above and a current PHP4 with a fully javascript
compliant browser, like Firefox).  The concept is based on a PDA
EMR program I wrote a few years ago, which was designed to limit
the need for direct text entry during a patient encounter. 
</p>
<p>
The structure of the form is three select menus titled 'category', 
'subcategory', and 'items' and a text box titled 'content'.  
Each of the three menus has a one line text box and a set of three buttons 
at the bottom and the 'content' text 
box has one button.
The buttons are labeled 'add', 'alter', and 'del'.  The 'add' button
adds to the menu above whatever has been typed in the one line text box
above the button.  The 'alter' button changes the selected text in the menu
to the typed text, again, in the box above the button.  The 'del' button
attempts to delete the selected text in the menu.  This will not work in
some situations.  For example, if you attempt to delete an element of the
'Category' menu, and that element is associated with existing subcategories,
you will not be allowed to delete until all of these subcategories are first deleted.
In turn, a subcategory cannot be deleted until all of the items under it, in other
words, the elements that appear in the 'Item' menu when a particular subcategory is
selected must all be deleted first before the selected subcategory may be deleted.
The text entered in the 'Content' box is directly associated with the selected element in
the 'Item' menu.  In fact, when you push the 'add' button below the 'Item' menu, you not only
add the new typed item to the menu, you also add the text in the 'Content' box.
