This directory holds the developer tools to maintain the language translations.
These were created during development of OpenEMR version 3.0.2

The collectConstants.pl script can be used to collect all of the constants
from the openemr source code.  This script uses the manuallyAddedConstants.txt and 
manuallyRemovedConstants.txt list to manually add or remove constants from
the final output. Note that it also requires a list of old constants
(this can be over-rided) to ensure no old constants are lost (ie ensure
previous versions of openemr are still supported) Instructions are included in
the file.

The buildLanguageDatabase.pl builds the foreign language SQL tables dumpfile
for the lang_languages, lang_constants, and lang_definitions tables from the
above current_spreadsheet.tsv file.  If input the list of constants it will also
to data validation on the constants and constant ID numbers and it will
create a spreadsheet that can be used to create a updated spreadsheet via
the combineConstantsSpreadsheet.pl script.

The combineConstantsSpreadsheet.pl script will combine a the list of constants
with the language spreadsheet to create a new spreadsheet that can be uploaded
to Google Docs.

The current official list of constants are kept in the currentConstants.txt file,
which are produced by the collectConstants.pl script.

The most current spreadsheet is kept in the current_spreadsheet.tsv file (this
file is taken after being processed with buildLanguageDatabase.pl script).

The combineConstantsSpreadsheet.pl script will combine a list of official constants
with the language spreadsheet to create a new spreadsheet that can be uploaded
to Google Docs.

When adding constants or removing constants then run the collectConstants.pl
script to create the list of constants. Then run the
combineConstantsSpreadsheet.pl script to re-build an official language spreadsheet
to export to Google Docs.

The Google Docs spreadsheet after conversion to tsv format (and processed by
the buildLanguageDatabase.pl is kept in the
current_spreadsheet.tsv file. Conversion is done by exporting spreadsheet
from google docs (ods format). Then, open this file in Open Office and 
select File->Save as. For 'Save as type:' select 'TEXT CSV (.csv)', toggle
on 'Edit Filter Setting', and change filename extension to .tsv. If asked
for confirmation select 'Yes'. Then select 'Unicode (UTF-8)' for 'Character
set', select {Tab} for 'Field delimiter', and select nothing (make blank by
removing the " character) for 'Text delimiter', and then click 'OK'.

The current_spreadsheet.tsv file is what can be uploaded to Google Docs for
collaboration.

The currentLanguage_utf8.sql and currentLanguage_latin1.sql holds current
sql tables dumpfile.

To insert these translation tables into your OpenEMR (please note, this
is currently experimental and will delete your current translation tables;
only perform this in your testing environements),
download the sql dumpfile to your computer. Then in OpenEMR go to 
admin -> Database -> Databases -> openemr -> SQL and click 'Browse'
button at the 'Or location of the textfile:' field. Select the sql dumpfile
you downloaded, then click 'Go' button.
