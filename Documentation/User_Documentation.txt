The Login Screen
To login to OpenEMR, first select the correct group name from the Group pulldown menu. The group is set in case multiple practices, or physician groups are using the same system. Next enter a username and password into the appropriate fields. Click the Login button to log into the system.  If the username, password, and group are incorrect, the login screen will reappear and you must enter a valid username, password, and group in order to use the system.

################
Automatic Logout
When a user is logged into OpenEMR and has not loaded any new interface screens, or has not accessed or modified data, an automatic timeout will lock the system after one hour. This setting is saved in the file located at interface/globals.php in the variable called $timeout. Though it may be changed from this file, it should be kept to a reasonable value for security based.

###########
Main Screen

##############
Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is located at the top of the screen. The first item of the navigation bar is the Find Patient entry and link. The second item is the New Patient link, the third item is the optional Users and Groups management screen, and the last item is the Logout link. The Users and Groups management link will only be displayed if the current user using the system is "authorized" (Information on Authorization status can be found in the Users and Groups management section).

To navigate to a patient file, type in the first few letters of a patient's last name into the entry, and click on the Find link. This will load the Patient Selection screen, with a list of existing patient files. If nothing is entered into Patient entry when the Find link is clicked, an alphabetical list of the first 100 or so patient files will be displayed.

Clicking on the New Patient link will load the Create New Patient Interface.

Clicking on the Users and Groups link will load the Users and Groups administrative management system.

Clicking on the Billing link will load the Billing Summary Interface.

Clicking on the Logout link will log the current user out of the system. This is required by HIPAA for logging access and use of patient files. When a user logs out of a session, the login screen is shown again, and a user must log in before accessing patient files.

###############
Information Bar
The name of the user that is currently logged in appears on the left hand side of the information bar. The current date is displayed on the right hand side of navigation bar.

############
Office Notes
Office-wide notes may be stored, recorded, and displayed by any user. This can be used to log important events they are not related to a specific patient. Only a few of the most recent office notes are displayed on the Main Screen, in order from the most recent to the oldest. If there are more office notes that have not been displayed, a warning message will be printed at the bottom of the displayed notes informing the user that not all notes were displayed. Clicking on this notice, or on the title link, "Office Notes" will load the full office notes interface.

######################
Office Notes Interface
To add a new comment, text should be entered into the large text entry box. To save the note, click on the Add New Note link. Notes may be Active or Inactive. To view all notes, click the View: All link. Otherwise, click on the View: Only Active or View: Only Inactive to see either active or inactive notes. Every note has a checkbox to the left of it - if the checkbox is checked, the note is active, if it is unchecked, the note is inactive. To change a note to active or inactive, check or uncheck the appropriate checkboxes to the left of the note you wish to change, and click on the Change Activity link. If there are many notes, only a few will be displayed at a time. To see the rest of the notes, click the Next link (or Previous link to navigate forward or backwards in time).

To exit the Office Notes Interface, click on the Office Notes title link.

########
Calendar
The calendar system provides health-care providers and their office staff an efficient way to schedule appointments with patients within the OpenEMR system. When the Main Screen is loaded, only a daily view of the calendar is displayed, with a list of text links on patient names. Clicking on a patient's name will load the Patient File Interface.

##################
Calendar Interface
If an "authorized" user logs into the system and loads the main screen (ie. Providers, Physicians), the initial calendar screen shows all of their appointments for the day. If the user is not authorized (ie. Office Support Staff), the initial calendar view shows the appointments for all authorized users for that day. Clicking the More text link loads the weekly view of the calendar, where a pull-down selects views per Provider or All Providers. Under the weekly view, clicking on the name of the day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) loads the comprehensive daily view. At any time, clicking on a patient's name loads the Patient File, or clicking on the appointment reason/description loads the Patient File, with a new patient encounter auto-populated with the calendar data.

Adding a new patient appointment begins by typing the patient's last name into the text entry box at the bottom of the screen. The name may be selected from the list of results. Clicking on the New Patient link loads an interface to add a new patient file. To add a new patient to OpenEMR, enter name and additional information into the text entry boxes and pulldown menus. Finally, an appointment interface loads and accepts various data about the patient's appointment.

To edit or delete a patient appointment, use the pulldown menu to the left of the Calendar Interface to load the daily view. Clicking on text title for a day in the weekly view (ie. Monday, Tuesday) will also load the daily view. In the daily view of the Calendar Interface, two links are shown titled Edit and Delete. Clicking the Edit text link will load the edit appointment interface at the bottom of the screen. Clicking the Delete text link will load the delete appointment interface at the bottom of the screen, and a prompt will verify that the appointment should be deleted.

######################
Changing User Password
Changing user passwords regularly is a good practice to ensure a higher standard of office security. Industry recommends that passwords are changed on a monthly basis - while this is often a hastle, it is nevertheless important. Memorization aids such as sticky-notes on monitors are a very bad practice, though common and widespread. To change a user password from the Main Screen, click on the navigation link titled, "Change Password". This will load the Change Password Interface

#########################
Change Password Interface
The Change Password Interface displays the real name, and username of the user currently logged in. It then presents two text entry boxes. To change the user password, the new password must be entered twice, once in each text entry box to assure the password is consistent. After the password has been entered twice, click the Save Changes button to save the password. If the password was not entered the same twice, an error will be displayed. Otherwise, a message will say that the password has been updated successfully, and provides a link to logout and relog in with the new password.

##############
Authorizations
If the current user is an authorized user, ie. a physician, the Authorizations screen will appear on the bottom half of the Main Screen. It displays a brief summary of all of the information that has been entered into the system by users who are not authorized, ie. office staff, subcatagorized and organized by patient name. The interface will display Billing, Transactions, Patient Notes, and Encounter Forms, but does not display changes to Demographics information or Patient History / Lifestyle information. Underneath the patient's name is a text link, "Authorize". Clicking this link means that a physician has viewed and authorized the changes. If the information should not be authorized, the physician should navigate to the patient file, make the necessary amendments, and then authorize the original record from the Authorizations screen. A few authorizations are listed by patient on the Main Screen. If there are more authorizations, a notice will say that more exist, and clicking on it or the Authorizations title link will load the Authorizations Interface. NOTE: Authorizations are provided for physicians to supervise the actions and data entry of office staff - they are not provided as a replacement comprehensive administration as implemented by practice policies.

########################
Authorizations Interface
This interface displays all authorizations, and operates the same way as the Authorizations screen from the Main Screen. To return to the Main Screen, click on the Authorizations title link.


######################
Finding a Patient File

To find a patient file, type the first few letters of the patient's last name into the Patient Find text entry box in the upper left hand of the screen. Then click the Find link. A list of patient files that exist in the system will be displayed alphabetically by last name, comma, first name. To go to a patient file, click on the patient's name.

############################
Create New Patient Interface
To return to the main screen, click on the Back text link in the upper right hand of the screen.
After filling out the First Name, Middle Name, and Last Name text entry boxes, clicking on the Add New Patient File text link will create the new patient file, and automatically open the Patient File Interface for the patient just created. If the patient is already entered into the system, the patient record is loaded. For convenience, the first letter of all words in the first, middle, and last name are capitalized, so that patient names can be typed as 'john doe' or 'jane doe', instead of "John Doe" or "Jane Doe". If the last name begins with a lower case letter, for example 'von' or 'van' of 'de', the name re-entered or modified from the Patient Summery Interface Screen.

###############
Billing Summary
The Billing Summary provides date-specific summaries of all billing and procedural codes entered into OpenEMR. To access the Billing Summary Interface, click on the Billing text link in the Main Scren Navigation Bar.

#########################
Billing Summary Interface
When the Billing Summary Interface loads, it will display all billing codes that have been entered for the current day, that are Authorized and that have not been marked as Billed. To change the start date of the range of dates displayed, edit the contents of the From text entry box. To change the end date of the range of dates displayed, edit the contents of the To. The dates must be entered in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" where YYYY is the year, MM is the numerical month starting with a zero, and DD is the numerical day starting with a zero if needed. (For example January 3rd, 2002 is represented by 2002-01-03) The pulldown box to the right of the To text entry field displays all of the different code types recorded. Selecting a specific code type to view shows only those codes that match the type, otherwise the default value is to show All Codes. To the right of the code type pulldown are two checkboxes. The first checkbox labelled "Only Show Unbilled Codes" is checked by default, and means that only the codes that have not been marked as billed are displayed. If it is unchecked, both billed and unbilled codes will be displayed. The second checkbox labelled "Only Show Authorized Codes" is checked by default, and means that only codes that have been Authorized by an Authorized user (ie. a physician) will be displayed. If it is unchecked, both Authorized and not Authorized codes will be displayed. Finally, to readjust the display criteria, click on the Change View text link to the far right.

A list of billing codes that match the search criteria will be catagorized by the patient for which they were coded. The code type, code, and date are displayed. If the entry is a copay, the amount of the copay is displayed as well. If billing occurs incrementally throughout the day, for example if a billing report is generated and faxed, it may be helpful to mark all of the codes currently being displayed as already Billed. This way, if a user generates new billing codes during the course of the day, the billing report is more accurate. To mark the codes currently visible as already Billed, click on the text link named "Mark All of These Codes As Billed".

When a group is defined, for example, the name of the medical practice, it contains users who are office staff, as well as users who are physicians. Physicians who require the ability to authorize the information that was entered by office staff must be "authorized" and should have this button checked when creating them as users.
